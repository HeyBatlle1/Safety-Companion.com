Q13: Glass Panel Size and Weight Considerations
Current: "Glass Panel Size and Weight Considerations"
Optimized (Repurposed as Handling Risk Assessment):
⚖️ GLASS HANDLING RISK FACTORS

Panel Weight Category:
☐ Light (<50 lbs, 1-2 person carry)
☐ Medium (50-150 lbs, 2-3 person carry)
☐ Heavy (150-300 lbs, 3-4 person + equipment)
☐ Extra Heavy (>300 lbs, mechanical lift REQUIRED)

Actual weight per panel: _____ lbs
Number of crew for manual handling: _____
Weight per person: _____ lbs (total weight ÷ crew size)

Manual Handling Risk:
☐ Low (<30 lbs per person)
☐ Medium (30-50 lbs per person)
☐ High (>50 lbs per person - ⚠️ STRAIN RISK)

Awkward Size/Shape:
☐ Standard rectangular (easy to grip)
☐ Large but manageable
☐ Oversized (>6 ft in any dimension - ⚠️ CONTROL RISK)
☐ Irregular shape (⚠️ BALANCE RISK)

Wind Exposure During Handling:
Panel surface area: _____ sq ft (width × height)
Wind force at 20 mph: _____ lbs (area × 1.3 lbs/sq ft)
Can crew resist wind force? ☐ Yes ☐ No (⚠️ LOSS OF CONTROL)

Crew Fatigue Factors:
Number of panels to install today: _____
Estimated time per panel: _____ minutes
Total handling time: _____ minutes
Planned rest breaks: Every _____ minutes

💡 Agent Note: Wind force on large panels is the #1 "loss of control" factor in Agent 3's causal chain. 60 sq ft panel in 20 mph wind = 78 lbs lateral force.

SECTION 5: Personnel Safety and Training (3 Questions)
Q14: Glass Installation Team Qualifications
Current: "Glass Installation Team Qualifications"
Optimized:
👷 CREW QUALIFICATIONS & EXPERIENCE

Crew Size:
Total workers: _____
Installers: _____
Crane operator: _____
Ground support: _____
Supervisor: _____

Competent Person (OSHA Required):
Name: __________________
Role: ☐ Foreman ☐ Site Supervisor ☐ Safety Manager
Qualifications: ☐ OSHA 30-hour ☐ Company-certified ☐ 5+ years experience

Crew Experience Level:
Foreman/Lead: _____ years in glass installation
Crew average: ☐ <1 year ☐ 1-3 years ☐ 3-5 years ☐ >5 years

Training Records:
☐ OSHA 10-hour Construction (all crew)
☐ OSHA 30-hour (supervisor/competent person)
☐ Fall Protection Training (within last year)
☐ Crane Signal Person (if applicable)
☐ First Aid/CPR (at least one crew member)

Specific Glass Installation Training:
☐ Manufacturer training (glass handling systems)
☐ On-the-job training (>6 months experience)
☐ Apprenticeship program
☐ No formal training (⚠️ COMPETENCY CONCERN)

Previous Glass Installation Experience:
☐ Same building type, same height
☐ Similar projects (different height/type)
☐ First time on project of this scale (⚠️ LEARNING CURVE RISK)

Near-Miss History (Last 90 Days):
☐ No near-misses or incidents
☐ 1-2 near-misses (documented and reviewed)
☐ 3+ near-misses (⚠️ PATTERN CONCERN)
☐ Unknown/not tracked (⚠️ SAFETY CULTURE GAP)

If near-misses occurred, were corrective actions taken?
☐ Yes (describe): ______________
☐ No (⚠️ REPEAT INCIDENT RISK)

🚨 CRITICAL: OSHA 1926.502(k) requires competent person for fall protection.
No identified competent person = compliance violation.

💡 Agent Note: "First time at this scale" + "no formal training" = Agent 3 predicts errors in judgment under pressure.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Training certificates (OSHA 10/30, fall protection)
✓ Crew team photo (for emergency identification)
✓ Competent person credentials

Q15: Required PPE for Glass Installation
Current: "Required PPE for Glass Installation"
Optimized:
🦺 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)

Required PPE for This Task:
☐ Hard Hat (Type I or II)
☐ Safety Glasses (ANSI Z87.1)
☐ Cut-Resistant Gloves (ANSI A3 or higher for glass)
☐ Work Gloves (general handling)
☐ Safety Boots (steel/composite toe)
☐ High-Visibility Vest (Class 2 or 3)
☐ Hearing Protection (if loud equipment)

Fall Protection PPE (if work >6 ft):
☐ Full-Body Harness (ANSI A10.32)
☐ Shock-Absorbing Lanyard or SRL
☐ Hard Hat with Chin Strap (for overhead work)

PPE Inspection Status:
☐ All PPE inspected before shift
☐ No defects found
☐ Minor wear (still serviceable)
☐ Damage found (replaced before work)
☐ Not inspected (⚠️ EQUIPMENT FAILURE RISK)

Common PPE Issues to Check:
Harness D-ring on BACK (not chest)? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Hard hat worn correctly (not backward)? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Gloves appropriate for glass (cut-resistant)? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Safety glasses worn (not on head)? ☐ Yes ☐ No

PPE Availability:
☐ Extra PPE available on-site (if damaged)
☐ No spare PPE (⚠️ if damage occurs, work stops)

💡 Agent Note: Agent 3 looks for "no cut-resistant gloves" + "glass handling" = laceration incident prediction.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Crew wearing full PPE (head-to-toe visible)
✓ Harness D-ring location (verify on back)
✓ Cut-resistant gloves close-up
✓ Hard hat with chin strap (if elevated work)

Q16: Communication Systems
Current: "Communication Systems"
Optimized:
📡 COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS & PROTOCOLS

Primary Communication Method:
☐ Two-Way Radios (channel: _____)
☐ Hand Signals (crane operations)
☐ Cell Phones
☐ Verbal (shouting)
☐ Combination (specify): ______________

Radio/Communication Checks:
☐ Tested before work started (all working)
☐ Spare batteries available
☐ Backup radios on-site
☐ Not tested (⚠️ COORDINATION RISK)

Communication Clarity:
Can ground crew hear workers at height clearly? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Can crane operator see hand signals from all angles? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Is there background noise interference? ☐ Yes (describe: _____) ☐ No

Emergency Communication Signals:
Emergency stop signal: ______________
"Man down" signal: ______________
"Evacuate" signal: ______________

All crew members briefed on emergency signals? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Emergency Contact Numbers (Posted On-Site):
911: ☐ Posted
Site Supervisor: ______________ ☐ Posted
Safety Manager: ______________ ☐ Posted
Nearest Hospital: ______________ ☐ Posted

Backup Communication:
If radios fail, backup method: ______________
☐ No backup plan (⚠️ SINGLE POINT FAILURE)

💡 Agent Note: "Verbal only" + "60 ft height" = Agent 3 predicts miscommunication in causal chain (Unsafe Act → Loss of Control).

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Radio check (crew with radios)
✓ Emergency contact numbers posted
✓ Hand signal chart (if using crane)
