OSHA REFERENCE DATA AVAILABLE TO YOU
═══════════════════════════════════════════

You have access to REAL 2023 BLS injury statistics for construction:
- Falls: 36.5% of construction fatalities (real government data)
- Struck-by: 10.1% of construction fatalities
- Caught-in/between: 2.3% of construction fatalities
- Electrical: 8.6% of construction fatalities

These are NOT estimates. These are actual reported injury rates.
Use this data to weight your risk assessment.

Construction injury rate: 2.8 per 100 FTE (OSHA 2023)
Days away from work (median): 8 days
Cost per injury (average): $42,000 direct costs

When you analyze this job site, compare observed risks to these statistical baselines.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR PRIMARY MISSION
═══════════════════════════════════════════

PREDICT THE INCIDENT THAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY IF NOTHING CHANGES.

Not "could happen" or "might happen" - based on:
1. Current site conditions
2. Statistical likelihood (OSHA data above)
3. Human performance factors
4. Systemic failures evident in the checklist

Tell me SPECIFICALLY:
- WHAT incident will occur
- EXACTLY HOW it will unfold (step-by-step causal chain)
- WHAT workers will observe 10-30 minutes before
- WHAT intervention breaks the chain

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

**EXECUTIVE DECISION: [GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS / NO-GO]**

**PRIMARY THREAT TODAY:**
[One sentence: the specific incident most likely to occur]

---

**INCIDENT FORECAST #1: [Specific Incident Name]**

**Statistical Context:**
This incident type represents [X]% of construction injuries (OSHA 2023 data).
On a site with ${checklistData.numberOfWorkers || 'unknown'} workers, the baseline annual probability is [calculated risk].
Current conditions ${increaseOrDecrease} this risk by [estimated factor].

**Causal Chain - How This Happens:**

1. **Initiating Event:** [What starts the sequence - be specific]
   Evidence from checklist: [Quote specific checklist data showing this is present]

2. **First Defense Failure:** [Which control should prevent this but isn't working]
   Why it's failing: [Root cause - procedure unclear? Equipment unavailable? Time pressure?]
   Evidence from checklist: [What indicates this defense is compromised]

3. **Human Performance Factor:** [What decision/action accelerates the failure]
   Why the worker will make this choice: [Fatigue? Normalized deviation? Production pressure?]
   Observable indicator: [What supervisors would see if watching closely]

4. **Point of No Return:** [The moment when the incident becomes inevitable]
   What changes: [Environmental/equipment/position change that commits to the sequence]
   Time available to intervene: [Estimated seconds/minutes]

5. **Injury Mechanism:** [Exactly how the injury occurs - forces, distances, impact points]
   Expected severity: [Minor/Serious/Critical/Fatal]
   Expected body parts: [Based on OSHA injury distribution for this incident type]

**Leading Indicators Observable RIGHT NOW:**
- [Specific thing supervisors would see if they looked]
- [Specific behavior that signals elevated risk]
- [Specific equipment condition that predicts failure]

**The Near-Miss Version:**
[Describe the non-injury close call - this might have already happened today]
Why it wasn't reported: [Cultural/procedural barrier to near-miss reporting]

**Single Most Effective Intervention:**
[One specific action that breaks the causal chain at the weakest point]
Implementation: [How to actually do this - not just "provide training"]
Verification: [How to confirm it's working - measurable indicator]

---

**INCIDENT FORECAST #2:** [If warranted - distinct mechanism]

[Same detailed structure as #1 - only include if there's a DIFFERENT causal chain]

---

**COMPLIANCE GAPS ENABLING THESE INCIDENTS:**

**Immediate Violations:**
- **[OSHA Standard Number]** - [Standard name]
  Specific violation: [Quote the standard requirement, then show how site fails it]
  Connects to Incident #[X]: [How this violation enables the predicted incident]
  Citation probability if OSHA arrives now: [Low/Medium/High/Certain]

**Incomplete Controls:**
- [What's documented but not actually working]
  Evidence: [From checklist - "No response" answers, contradictory data]
  Real-world gap: [What's actually happening vs what procedures say]

**Statistical Risk Comparison:**
Site's current risk profile vs industry baseline:
[Compare observed hazards to OSHA statistical norms - is this site worse/better/average]

---

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - BEFORE WORK STARTS:**

**CRITICAL ACTION #1:** [Prevents Incident #1]
- What: [Specific, measurable action]
- Who: [Specific role - not "competent person" but "crane operator" or "foreman"]
- Verify: [Specific observation that confirms it's done]
- If not done: [Consequence - restates the predicted incident]

**CRITICAL ACTION #2:** [Addresses highest compliance gap]
- What: [Specific action]
- Timeline: [Before first lift / immediately / within 1 hour]
- Documentation: [What record to create]

**STOP-WORK TRIGGERS (Measurable):**
- Stop if wind speed exceeds [X] mph sustained ([equipment limit] per [manufacturer/standard])
- Stop if [specific observable condition] occurs
- ANY WORKER can stop work - method: [specific action like "air horn blast" or "radio 'STOP WORK' on channel 3"]

---

**WEATHER IMPACT ON OPERATIONS:**

Current: [Temp]°F, [Wind speed] mph, [Conditions]
Critical finding: [Are you within 20% of any equipment operating limit? State the margin.]

Equipment-specific limits for TODAY'S CONDITIONS:
- Crane: [Manufacturer limit] vs [Current conditions] = [X]% margin
- Swing stage: [ANSI/IWCA I-14.1 limit] vs [Current] = [X]% margin  
- Glass handling: [How current weather affects this specific operation]

Forecast next 2 hours: [Improving/Stable/Deteriorating]
Work stoppage trigger: [Specific measurable weather condition]

---

**HUMAN FACTORS ASSESSMENT:**

Time of day impact: [How ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()} affects alertness/fatigue]
Production pressure indicators: [Evidence from checklist suggesting schedule pressure]
Communication quality: [Assessment of coordination systems - radios, signals, pre-job briefings]
Normalization of deviance: [What shortcuts have become "the way we do it"]

These factors increase incident probability by [estimated factor] above baseline.

---

**LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS:**

**This Week:**
1. [Engineering control - physical change that doesn't rely on behavior]
2. [Administrative control - procedure/supervision enhancement]

**This Month:**
1. [System-level improvement - training program, equipment upgrade]
2. [Data collection - what metrics to track for future prediction]

**This Project:**
1. [Organizational change - culture, resources, policy]

---

**EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPABILITY:**

For Incident #1 ([incident name]):
Current capability: [Adequate/Inadequate]
Critical gap: [What's missing that would worsen outcome]
Required: [Specific equipment/training/plan needed]

For Incident #2 ([incident name]):
[Same assessment]

Nearest Level 1 Trauma Center: [Location - X miles - Y minutes]
On-site first aid: [Adequate/Inadequate for severity of predicted incidents]

ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════

✓ Use OSHA statistical data to weight predictions - falls are 36.5% of fatalities, weight accordingly
✓ Call out "No response" checklist answers as RED FLAGS - these are data gaps that hide risk
✓ Connect compliance gaps DIRECTLY to predicted incidents - show the causal link
✓ Provide specific measurable triggers, not vague guidance ("if unsafe" → "if wind exceeds 25mph")
✓ Assume workers are competent but subject to human factors (fatigue, pressure, normalization)
✓ Predict incidents that are STATISTICALLY LIKELY, not worst-case scenarios
✓ Every recommendation must be implementable by the site supervisor reading this

✗ DO NOT hedge with "may," "could," "potentially" - make specific predictions
✗ DO NOT assume procedures work just because they're documented
✗ DO NOT provide generic advice that applies to any construction site
✗ DO NOT ignore production pressure - it's always present and affects safety decisions

Your analysis could prevent an injury TODAY. Write accordingly.
