Okay, here's a safety analysis of the provided Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) checklist, focusing on identifying risks, assessing compliance, and providing actionable recommendations.

**Subject:** Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) Review and Recommendations for Glass Installation/Curtain Wall Project

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Critical Safety Risks Identified**

Based on the provided JHA responses, the following critical safety risks are identified:

*   **Fall Hazards:** Working at a height of 39.8 feet presents a significant fall hazard. The response mentions PFAS systems and a stage platform/boom lift but needs more detail.  Insufficient or improperly used fall protection could result in serious injury or death.

*   **Material Handling Hazards:** Handling large glass panels (76in x 76in, double insulated) introduces risks of strains, sprains, cuts, and crush injuries if not handled properly. Determining the weight per square foot and the total weight of each panel is crucial for proper rigging and lifting procedures.

*   **Weather Conditions:** The weather conditions (78°F, 35% humidity, Wind: 14 mph (gusts 22 mph), Pressure: 1008 hPa) could impact worker safety, especially high winds. Gusts exceeding 20 mph can significantly affect the stability of materials and workers at height.

*   **Potential Electrocution Hazards:** The response indicates that GFCIs are site-wide, and the crew is running off building power. While this is good, relying solely on building power requires constant vigilance. There's always a risk of unforeseen electrical hazards if power sources are not properly maintained or if temporary wiring is needed.

**2. Compliance Status Assessment**

*   **Potentially Compliant (Needs Further Review):** The responses suggest an awareness of OSHA standards, but the level of detail is insufficient to definitively determine full compliance.
    *   **OSHA 1926.501 (Fall Protection):**  Mention of PFAS suggests an attempt at compliance, but *proof* of proper inspection, training, and correct usage is needed.
    *   **OSHA 1926.701 (Concrete and Masonry Construction):** Applicable for glass curtain wall installation.
    *   **OSHA 1926.416 (Electrical Safety):** The use of GFCIs is a good practice, but a comprehensive electrical safety program is required.
    *   **OSHA 1926.95 (General Requirements for PPE):** Indicated all PPE is in good order. Need to prove the appropriateness of the PPE for the tasks performed (Impact protection, cut resistance, fall protection).
*   **Areas of Concern:**
    *   **Material Handling:**  The JHA does not explicitly address safe lifting techniques, load calculations, or the use of mechanical aids for glass panel installation.
    *   **Weather Conditions:**  The JHA does not explicitly address work practices to address the wind speed and gusts.

**3. Immediate Action Items**

*   **Detailed Fall Protection Plan:** Develop and implement a detailed fall protection plan that *specifically* addresses the 39.8-foot working height. This plan must include:
    *   Specific fall protection equipment to be used (harnesses, lanyards, anchor points, guardrails, safety nets).
    *   Inspection procedures for all fall protection equipment *before each shift*.
    *   Rescue plan in case of a fall.
    *   Competent person to oversee fall protection implementation.
*   **Glass Panel Weight Calculation and Safe Lifting Plan:**
    *   Calculate the exact weight of each glass panel (including glass type and thickness).
    *   Develop a safe lifting plan that includes:
        *   Number of workers required for each lift.
        *   Use of mechanical lifting devices (e.g., vacuum lifters).
        *   Proper rigging and slinging techniques.
        *   Clear communication protocols during lifting operations.
    *   Ensure workers are trained on safe lifting techniques and the specific procedures for handling these glass panels.
*   **Wind Speed Monitoring and Contingency Plan:**
    *   Establish a system for monitoring wind speed on-site.
    *   Develop a contingency plan that specifies when work at height must be suspended due to high winds. This should be based on the manufacturer's recommendations for the boom lift and other lifting equipment, as well as OSHA guidelines.  Consider reducing the allowable wind speed due to the large size of the glass panels.
    *   Communicate the wind speed limits and suspension procedures to all workers.

**4. Long-Term Recommendations**

*   **Comprehensive JHA Review:** Conduct a more in-depth Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) that breaks down each task involved in the glass installation process.  This should identify all potential hazards and outline specific control measures.
*   **Written Safety Program:** Develop a comprehensive written safety program that covers all aspects of the glass installation project, including:
    *   Fall protection procedures
    *   Material handling procedures
    *   Electrical safety procedures
    *   Emergency response plan
    *   Hazard communication program
*   **Regular Safety Audits:** Conduct regular safety audits to ensure compliance with the safety program and to identify any potential hazards.
*   **Toolbox Talks:** Conduct daily toolbox talks to discuss specific hazards and safe work practices for the day's tasks.

**5. Training Needs**

*   **Fall Protection Training:** Ensure *all* workers involved in the project receive comprehensive fall protection training that meets OSHA requirements (1926.503).  This should include hands-on training on the proper use and inspection of fall protection equipment.
*   **Material Handling Training:** Provide training on safe lifting techniques, rigging, and the use of mechanical lifting devices.
*   **Electrical Safety Training:** Provide electrical safety training that covers the hazards of working with electricity and the proper use of GFCIs.
*   **Boom Lift Training/Certification:** All operators must have documented boom lift training and certification

**6. Follow-Up Requirements**

*   **Document Review:** Review all safety documentation (JHAs, training records, inspection reports) to verify compliance.
*   **Site Inspection:** Conduct a thorough site inspection to identify any potential hazards and to ensure that all safety procedures are being followed.
*   **Employee Interviews:** Interview workers to assess their understanding of safety procedures and to identify any concerns.
*   **Regular Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the site for hazards, especially regarding weather, and ensure compliance with all safety procedures.

**Specific Regulatory References:**

*   **29 CFR 1926 Subpart E - Personal Protective and Life Saving Equipment**
*   **29 CFR 1926 Subpart M - Fall Protection**
*   **29 CFR 1926 Subpart K - Electrical**
*   **29 CFR 1926 Subpart N - Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevators, and Conveyors**
*   **ANSI A10.48 – Safety Requirements for Construction and Demolition Operations – Erection and Removal of Curtain Walls.**

**Practical Implementation Guidance:**

*   **Engage Workers:** Involve workers in the JHA process to get their input and ensure that safety procedures are practical and effective.
*   **Communicate Clearly:** Ensure that all safety information is communicated clearly and effectively to all workers.
*   **Lead by Example:** Supervisors and managers must lead by example and demonstrate a commitment to safety.

By addressing these critical risks and implementing the recommended actions, you can significantly improve the safety of the glass installation project and ensure compliance with OSHA regulations.
