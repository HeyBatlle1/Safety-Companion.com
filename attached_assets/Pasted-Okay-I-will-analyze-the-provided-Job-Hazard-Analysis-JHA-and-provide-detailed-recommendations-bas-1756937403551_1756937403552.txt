Okay, I will analyze the provided Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) and provide detailed recommendations based on my expertise in safety and regulatory compliance.

**Analysis of Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) for Glass Installation/Curtain Wall**

Here's a structured analysis of the provided JHA, focusing on identified risks, compliance, and recommendations:

**1. Critical Safety Risks Identified**

*   **Fall Hazards:** Working at a maximum height of 39.8 feet poses a significant fall hazard. The use of a stage platform and boom lift increases the complexity of the fall protection requirements. While PFAS (Personal Fall Arrest Systems) are reportedly inspected, their proper use, anchorage points, and clearance distances are critical.
*   **Material Handling Hazards:** Large and heavy glass panels (76in x 76in double-insulated) present ergonomic and impact hazards. Moving, lifting, and installing these panels manually or with insufficient equipment can lead to strains, sprains, crushing injuries, or dropped loads. Determining the weight per square foot and total panel weight is crucial.
*   **Electrical Hazards:** While GFCI protection is in place, reliance on the building's power requires verification of the electrical system's capacity and integrity. Improper extension cord usage, damaged wiring, or overloading circuits remain potential hazards.
*   **Struck-By Hazards:** Dropping tools, materials (including glass), or being struck by moving equipment (boom lift) or other objects on the site.
*   **Boom Lift Safety:** Boom lifts introduce tip-over hazards, electrocution hazards (if working near power lines), and collision hazards.

**2. Compliance Status Assessment**

*   **OSHA 1926.95 (General Requirements for PPE):** Compliance appears to be addressed regarding basic PPE, but the specific PPE needs for glass installation (cut-resistant gloves, eye protection) may require further evaluation.
*   **OSHA 1926.501 (Fall Protection):**  While PFAS are mentioned, the details regarding proper anchorage, clearance distances, and rescue plans need clarification. The use of stage platforms and boom lifts brings in additional fall protection requirements.
*   **OSHA 1926.502 (Fall Protection Systems Criteria and Practices):** This standard provides specific requirements for guardrail systems, safety net systems, and personal fall arrest systems. Verification of compliance with these specific requirements is crucial.
*   **OSHA 1926.416 (Electrical Safety):** While GFCI is present, the condition and suitability of the building's electrical system must be verified. Safe work practices for electrical safety are essential.
*   **OSHA 1926.550 (Cranes and Derricks in Construction)** Depending on the equipment used to lift and install the glass, certain parts of this standard may apply, particularly those related to rigging and signaling.
*   **OSHA 1926.20 (Accident Prevention Responsibilities):**  The employer is responsible for initiating and maintaining accident prevention programs, including frequent and regular inspections of the job site.

**3. Immediate Action Items**

*   **Weight Calculation:** Immediately calculate the weight of the glass panels (76" x 76" double-insulated).  This is crucial for selecting appropriate lifting equipment and determining safe lifting practices.
*   **Fall Protection Review:** Conduct a detailed review of the fall protection plan, including specific anchorage points, clearance distances, and a rescue plan. Ensure the PFAS are appropriate for the weight and height of the work being performed.
*   **Boom Lift Inspection:** Perform a thorough pre-shift inspection of the boom lift. Verify operator certification and adherence to safe operating procedures. Check for tip-over hazards and maintain safe distances from any overhead power lines.
*   **Electrical System Assessment:** Verify the capacity and integrity of the building's electrical system. Ensure extension cords are properly sized and in good condition.
*   **Toolbox Talk:** Conduct a daily toolbox talk covering the specific hazards associated with glass installation, fall protection, and boom lift operation.
*   **Emergency Contact Verification:** Confirm and post emergency contact information (hospital, EMS). Review emergency procedures with all personnel.
*   **Struck-By Hazards:** Ensure all personnel are aware of the risk of falling objects and struck-by hazards. Establish drop zones and implement measures to secure tools and materials at heights.

**4. Long-Term Recommendations**

*   **Engineering Controls:** Implement engineering controls to minimize hazards wherever possible. This may include using mechanical lifting devices, vacuum lifters, or other equipment to reduce manual handling of glass panels.
*   **Written Fall Protection Plan:** Develop a comprehensive written fall protection plan that addresses all fall hazards on the site, including the specific requirements for stage platforms and boom lifts.
*   **Load Testing:** If any rigging or lifting equipment is modified or its capacity is in question, conduct load testing to verify its safety and functionality.
*   **Regular Inspections:** Conduct regular inspections of the work site, equipment, and fall protection systems to identify and correct any hazards. Document all inspections.
*   **Hazard Communication:** Ensure all chemicals (e.g., adhesives, sealants) used in the glass installation are properly labeled and that SDSs are readily available. Provide training on the hazards and safe handling procedures for these chemicals.

**5. Training Needs**

*   **Refresher Fall Protection Training:** Conduct refresher training on fall protection, including proper inspection and use of PFAS, anchor point selection, and rescue procedures.
*   **Boom Lift Operator Training:** Ensure all boom lift operators are properly trained and certified in accordance with OSHA standards.
*   **Rigging and Signaling Training:** If cranes or other rigging equipment are used, provide training on safe rigging practices and signaling procedures.
*   **Ergonomics Training:** Provide training on proper lifting techniques and ergonomic principles to minimize the risk of strains and sprains when handling glass panels.
*   **Hazard Communication Training:** Ensure all employees receive hazard communication training on the chemicals they are exposed to, including how to read SDSs and use appropriate PPE.

**6. Follow-Up Requirements**

*   **Documentation:** Maintain accurate records of all training, inspections, and corrective actions.
*   **JHA Updates:** Review and update the JHA as needed to reflect changes in work conditions, equipment, or procedures.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Implement a system for reporting and investigating all incidents, near misses, and injuries.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the safety program and make adjustments as needed to improve safety performance.

By implementing these recommendations, you can significantly improve the safety of the glass installation project and ensure compliance with OSHA regulations. Remember that this is a general assessment, and a thorough on-site evaluation by a qualified safety professional is always recommended to identify and address all potential hazards.
