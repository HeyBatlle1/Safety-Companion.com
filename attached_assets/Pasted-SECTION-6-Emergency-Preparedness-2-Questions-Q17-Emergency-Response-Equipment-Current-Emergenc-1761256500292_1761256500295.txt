SECTION 6: Emergency Preparedness (2 Questions)
Q17: Emergency Response Equipment
Current: "Emergency Response Equipment"
Optimized:
🚑 EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT & READINESS

First Aid/Medical Equipment:
☐ First Aid Kit (OSHA 1910.151 compliant)
☐ AED (Automated External Defibrillator)
☐ Trauma Kit (for serious injuries)
☐ Oxygen (if available)
☐ Eye Wash Station (for chemical exposure)

Equipment Location:
First Aid: ______________ (specific location, e.g., "ground level, blue box")
AED: ______________ (within 3-minute travel time required)
Rescue Equipment: ______________

Equipment Inspection:
☐ All equipment inspected before shift
☐ First aid kit fully stocked
☐ AED pads not expired (check date: _____ / _____ / _____)
☐ Not inspected (⚠️ READINESS CONCERN)

Fall Rescue Equipment (if working >6 ft):
☐ Descent Device (for lowering fallen worker)
☐ Retrieval System (mechanical advantage)
☐ Trauma Straps (suspension relief)
☐ None (⚠️ OSHA VIOLATION - rescue within 6 min required)

Crew Training on Equipment:
☐ All crew First Aid/CPR certified
☐ Designated person trained on AED
☐ Rescue team trained on descent device
☐ No training (⚠️ EQUIPMENT WON'T BE USED EFFECTIVELY)

Emergency Response Time Estimates:
Fall rescue (on-site team): _____ minutes (max 6 min allowed)
EMS arrival: _____ minutes
Helicopter medevac: ☐ Available ☐ Not available
Nearest Trauma Center: ______________ (_____ minutes away)

🚨 CRITICAL: Fall arrest without rescue = suspension trauma → death in 30 minutes.
OSHA requires rescue within 6 minutes.

💡 Agent Note: "No AED" + "electrical work nearby" = Agent 4 flags emergency readiness as FAILED → NO-GO decision.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ First aid kit (open, showing contents)
✓ AED (with expiration date visible on pads)
✓ Rescue equipment staged nearby
✓ Equipment location signage

Q18: Emergency Response Plan Status
Current: "Emergency Response Plan Status"
Optimized:
📋 EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN (EAP)

EAP Status:
☐ Written EAP available on-site (attach photo/PDF)
☐ Generic company EAP (not site-specific)
☐ Verbal plan only (⚠️ NOT COMPLIANT - OSHA requires written)
☐ No EAP (⚠️ AUTOMATIC NO-GO)

EAP Components:
☐ Evacuation routes marked
☐ Assembly point designated: ______________ (location)
☐ Emergency contact numbers posted
☐ Hospital route map available
☐ Weather evacuation plan (high winds, lightning)
☐ Rescue procedures documented

Assembly Point:
Location: ______________
Distance from building: _____ feet
Safe from falling objects? ☐ Yes ☐ No
Can all crew reach it in <2 minutes? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Emergency Communication Tree:
Who calls 911: ______________ (name, role)
Who notifies site supervisor: ______________
Who notifies safety manager: ______________

Crew Awareness:
☐ All crew briefed on EAP today
☐ Briefed this week
☐ Briefed >1 week ago
☐ Not briefed (⚠️ CREW DOESN'T KNOW PLAN)

EAP Drills:
Last EAP drill conducted: _____ / _____ / _____
☐ <30 days ago (excellent)
☐ 30-90 days ago (acceptable)
☐ >90 days ago (⚠️ STALE)
☐ Never conducted (⚠️ UNTESTED PLAN)

Nearest Hospital Details:
Name: ______________
Address: ______________
Drive time: _____ minutes
Trauma center? ☐ Yes ☐ No

🚨 CRITICAL: OSHA 1926.35 requires written EAP for sites with >10 employees.
No written plan = compliance violation.

💡 Agent Note: "No EAP" + "High-risk work" = Agent 4 automatic NO-GO decision.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Written EAP document (first page)
✓ Assembly point location
✓ Evacuation route signage
✓ Emergency contact numbers posted
✓ Hospital route map

SECTION 7: Public Safety and Site Security (2 Questions)
Q19: Ground Level Protection Systems (MOST CRITICAL)
Current: "Ground Level Protection Systems"
⚠️ THIS IS THE CRITICAL GAP FROM EXAMPLE ANALYSIS (sa-19)
Optimized:
🚧 GROUND-LEVEL PROTECTION SYSTEMS (CRITICAL!)

Public Fall Zone Assessment:
Building/work height: _____ feet
Required exclusion zone: _____ feet (1 ft per 10 ft height minimum)
Actual exclusion zone: _____ feet
Is exclusion adequate? ☐ Yes ☐ No (⚠️ PUBLIC EXPOSURE RISK)

Barricade System:
☐ Hard Barricades (concrete barriers, fencing)
☐ Caution Tape (3-strand minimum)
☐ Traffic Cones with chains
☐ Safety Netting (overhead protection)
☐ None (🚨 AUTOMATIC NO-GO - CRITICAL VIOLATION)

Barricade Status:
☐ Installed and secure (before work starts)
☐ Needs installation (work cannot start)
☐ Not planned (🚨 STOP - this is required by OSHA 1926.760)

Overhead Protection:
☐ Safety Netting installed
☐ Catch Platform
☐ Canopy/Awning
☐ None (barricades must be larger if no overhead protection)

Ground-Level Monitoring:
☐ Dedicated Spotter (person monitoring fall zone)
    - Name: ______________
    - Position: ______________
    - Equipped with: ☐ Air horn ☐ Two-way radio ☐ High-vis vest
☐ No spotter (⚠️ NO ACTIVE DEFENSE)

Public Traffic Volume:
☐ High (sidewalk, main entrance, parking lot)
☐ Medium (occasional pedestrian traffic)
☐ Low (restricted area, limited access)
☐ None (isolated site, no public nearby)

Signage:
☐ "DANGER - OVERHEAD WORK" signs posted
☐ "HARD HAT AREA" signs
☐ "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"
☐ No signage (⚠️ PUBLIC UNAWARE OF HAZARD)

Enforcement:
☐ Security guard on-site
☐ Supervisor actively monitoring
☐ No enforcement (⚠️ BARRICADE BREACH RISK)

Breach Response Plan:
If someone enters fall zone:
☐ Spotter sounds alarm (air horn)
☐ All overhead work STOPS immediately
☐ Person is escorted out
☐ No plan (⚠️ STRUCK-BY INCIDENT LIKELY)

🚨 THIS IS THE #1 MISSING CONTROL FROM JHAS!

OSHA 1926.760(a): "The employer shall erect or have erected on the site, as necessary, a barrier, railing or any other effective means to prevent entrance to the fall zone."

Per example analysis: "Missing ground-level protection = most pressing concern, constitutes severe OSHA violation."

Agent 3 predicts: "Glass panel strikes ground-level worker" when this section is inadequate.

💡 Agent Note: If this field says "Same" or "TBD" or "None", Agent 4 issues AUTOMATIC NO-GO decision.

📷 REQUIRED PHOTOS (Not Optional!):
✓ Full perimeter barricade (aerial/ground view)
✓ Barricade at each side of building
✓ Fall zone marked on ground
✓ Signage at entry points
✓ Spotter position (where they stand)
✓ Overhead netting (if installed)

☐ Commercial (operating businesses)
☐ Parking areas (vehicles present)
☐ Public Right-of-Way (sidewalks, streets)
☐ Vacant/Unoccupied
☐ None (isolated site)

Closest Property Distance: _____ feet from work area

Property Owner Notification:
☐ All adjacent owners notified in writing (attach proof)
☐ Verbal notification only
☐ No notification (⚠️ COMMUNITY RELATIONS RISK)

☐ Work schedule (dates/times)
☐ Noise/disruption warning
☐ Safety measures in place
☐ Emergency contact info

Protection Measures for Adjacent Property:

☐ Vehicles moved to safe area
☐ Covered parking structures protected
☐ None (⚠️ VEHICLE DAMAGE RISK)

☐ Power lines from adjacent building
☐ Overhanging trees/structures
☐ HVAC exhaust/vents
☐ None identified

Coordination with Adjacent Activity:
☐ No other work happening nearby
☐ Coordinated with other contractors
☐ Uncoordinated (⚠️ CONFLICT RISK)

💡 Agent Note: Residential property + inadequate notification = community complaints = work stoppage.
