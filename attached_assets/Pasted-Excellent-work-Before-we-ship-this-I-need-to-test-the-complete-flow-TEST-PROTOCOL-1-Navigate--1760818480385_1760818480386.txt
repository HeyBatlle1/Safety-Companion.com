Excellent work! Before we ship this, I need to test the complete flow.

TEST PROTOCOL:

1. Navigate to a checklist form (e.g., confined-space or master-jha)

2. Fill out with REALISTIC data:
   - Project: "Downtown Office Construction"
   - Location: "Indianapolis, IN"
   - Work Type: "Glass Installation at Height"
   - Equipment: "Tower crane, swing stage, suction cups"
   - Height: "60 feet"
   - Weather: Use real current weather
   - PPE: "Hard hats, safety harnesses, gloves"
   - Emergency Plan: "Assembly point at ground level"
   - CRITICAL: Leave 2-3 fields with vague answers like "same" or "yes"

3. Submit the analysis

4. WATCH THE AGENT PIPELINE:
   - Should see 4 separate agent calls
   - Each returns structured JSON
   - Final synthesis combines them

5. VERIFY THE UI:
   - Executive Summary appears with decision badge
   - Risk score shows as X/100 with gauge
   - All 4 agent cards appear collapsed
   - "Tap any card to view" hint visible

6. TEST INTERACTIONS:
   - Click Agent 1 - should expand smoothly
   - Click Agent 2 - Agent 1 should collapse, Agent 2 expands
   - Click Agent 3 - Agent 2 collapses, Agent 3 expands
   - Within Agent 3, test the 3 tabs (Causal Chain, Indicators, Interventions)

7. TEST ACTION BAR:
   - Click "View JSON" - modal should open with agent data
   - Try downloading JSON
   - Try copying to clipboard
   - Test Share button (if on mobile)

8. TEST MOBILE:
   - Open on mobile device or resize browser to 375px
   - Verify cards stack vertically
   - Verify action bar is sticky at bottom
   - Verify executive summary is readable

Take screenshots at each major step and report back with:
- Any errors in console
- Any visual glitches
- Any missing data
- Performance (was it slow?)

DO NOT skip this testing. This is production safety software.

## **Expected Behavior:**

### **If Everything Works:**
```
âœ… Executive Summary: Shows CONDITIONAL_GO or NO_GO (unlikely to be GO on first test)
âœ… Agent 1: Shows quality score 6-8/10 (due to vague answers)
âœ… Agent 2: Shows risk score 40-90/100 depending on hazards
âœ… Agent 3: Shows incident prediction with 40-80% probability
âœ… All animations smooth (no jank)
âœ… Mobile layout works
âœ… Action buttons functional
```

### **If Something's Wrong:**
```
ðŸš¨ Console errors â†’ Debug immediately
ðŸš¨ Missing data â†’ Check agent output structure
ðŸš¨ No animations â†’ Check Framer Motion setup
ðŸš¨ Layout broken â†’ Check Tailwind classes
ðŸš¨ API timeout â†’ Agents taking too long (reduce complexity)
