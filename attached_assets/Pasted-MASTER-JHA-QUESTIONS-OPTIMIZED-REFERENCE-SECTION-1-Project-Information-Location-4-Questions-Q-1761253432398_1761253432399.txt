Q4: Public Exposure & Ground-Level Protection
Current: "Public Exposure Level"
Optimized:
🚶 PUBLIC EXPOSURE & GROUND-LEVEL PROTECTION

Public Traffic Below Work Area:
☐ High (sidewalk, main entrance, parking)
☐ Medium (occasional pedestrian traffic)
☐ Low (restricted area, limited access)
☐ None (isolated site, no public access)

Exclusion Zone:
Barricade Distance: _____ feet from building
(Minimum: 1 foot per 10 feet of height, e.g., 60 ft high = 60 ft exclusion)

Ground-Level Protection Systems:
☐ Hard Barricades (fencing/concrete barriers)
☐ Caution Tape / Soft Barricades
☐ Safety Netting (overhead protection)
☐ Dedicated Spotter (person monitoring area)
☐ None (CRITICAL VIOLATION - see note below)

Barricade Status:
☐ Installed and secure
☐ Needs installation (BEFORE work starts)
☐ Not planned (STOP - do not proceed)

Adjacent Activity:
☐ Active construction nearby
☐ Operating businesses
☐ Residential area
☐ Empty/unoccupied

🚨 CRITICAL: No ground-level protection = AUTOMATIC NO-GO
Per OSHA 1926.760, falling object protection is REQUIRED when public exposure exists.

💡 Agent Note: This is the #1 gap from most JHAs. Agent 3 predicts struck-by incidents when this is inadequate.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Ground-level view showing public traffic
✓ Barricade setup (if installed)
✓ Fall zone perimeter
✓ Adjacent properties/activities
✓ Signage (warning signs, caution tape)
