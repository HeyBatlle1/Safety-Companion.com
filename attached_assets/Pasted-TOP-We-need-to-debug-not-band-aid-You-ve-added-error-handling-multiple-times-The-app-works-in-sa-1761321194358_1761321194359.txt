TOP. We need to debug, not band-aid.
You've added error handling multiple times. The app works in sandbox but fails in production with infinite loading loops across all devices/platforms during auth.
That means error handling isn't the problem. Something fundamental is broken.
Let's think like engineers debugging a production issue:
DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:

What exactly happens during the loading loop?

Show me the browser console logs during a failed auth attempt
What's the last successful network request before it hangs?
Is it stuck on Supabase auth callback? Session validation? Database query?


What's different between sandbox and production?

Environment variables properly set in Railway?
CORS configuration correct for production domain?
Supabase redirect URLs configured for production URL?
Session cookie settings (secure/sameSite) breaking in production?


Auth flow trace:

User clicks sign in → Request sent to /api/login → What happens next?
Does Supabase return a session?
Does the session get stored correctly?
Where does the redirect fail?


Recent commits that might have caused this:

"Add diagnostics for Supabase connections and authentication" (7 hours ago)
"Add a timeout to user sign-in to prevent infinite loading" (7 hours ago)

Those sound like symptoms of a deeper problem.

STOP ADDING ERROR HANDLERS. Instead:

Add console.log() statements at EVERY step of the auth flow
Show me the exact sequence that executes during a failed login
Identify where it stops/loops
Show me the actual error or state that causes the hang

What would cause infinite loading in production but not sandbox?

Supabase redirect URL mismatch
CORS blocking the callback
Session storage failing (cookie settings)
Environment variable missing/wrong
Network timeout (no error thrown, just hangs)

Show me the auth flow code and the console output from a failed production login attempt. Don't add anything - just show me what's happening.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
