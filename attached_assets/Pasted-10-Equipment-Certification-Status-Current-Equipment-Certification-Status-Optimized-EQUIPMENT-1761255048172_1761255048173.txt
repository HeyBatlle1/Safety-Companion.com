📋 EQUIPMENT CERTIFICATION & INSPECTION RECORDS

Crane/Lift Equipment Certification:
Last inspection date: _____ / _____ / _____
Inspection type: ☐ Annual ☐ Quarterly ☐ Pre-use
Inspector name: ________________
Inspector credentials: ☐ NCCCO ☐ Manufacturer ☐ Competent Person (company)
Next inspection due: _____ / _____ / _____

Equipment Serial/ID Numbers:
Crane: _______________
Boom/Lift: _______________
Rigging: _______________

Rigging Inspection:
☐ Inspected before each use (OSHA required)
☐ Inspected weekly
☐ Inspected monthly
☐ No regular inspection (⚠️ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION)

Inspector for rigging: ________________ (Competent Person?)

Inspection Findings (Any defects?):
☐ All equipment passed inspection
☐ Minor issues (corrected before use)
☐ Major issues found: ________________
☐ Not documented (⚠️ CONCERN)

Load Testing (if applicable):
Last load test: _____ / _____ / _____
Test capacity: _____ lbs
Test result: ☐ Passed ☐ Failed ☐ Not tested

Fall Protection Equipment Certs:
Harnesses certified: ☐ Yes (attach cert photo) ☐ No
Lanyards certified: ☐ Yes (attach cert photo) ☐ No
Anchorage certified: ☐ Yes (by engineer) ☐ No

🚨 CRITICAL: OSHA 1926.1412 requires annual crane inspection by qualified person.
Expired certs = AUTOMATIC NO-GO decision.

💡 Agent Note: "Up to date" without dates = Agent 1 flags as insufficient response.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Inspection tags on equipment (dates visible)
✓ Certification documents
✓ Crane nameplate (serial number)
✓ Load chart placard
✓ Inspector's credentials (if available)

SECTION 4: Glass Storage and Material Handling (3 Questions)
Q11: Glass Storage Area Conditions
Current: "Glass Storage Area Conditions"
Optimized:
📦 GLASS STORAGE LOCATION & PROTECTION

Storage Area Location:
Distance from building: _____ feet
Distance from edge/excavation: _____ feet (minimum 6 ft required)
Ground conditions: ☐ Level/stable ☐ Sloped ☐ Soft/unstable

Fall Protection Around Storage:
☐ Guardrails (if near edge >6 ft)
☐ Barricades/caution tape
☐ No edge nearby (storage in safe area)
☐ None (⚠️ RISK if near edge)

Glass Rack/Support System:
☐ A-frame racks (angled, stable)
☐ Vertical racks (secure)
☐ Laid flat (on padding)
☐ Leaning against structure (⚠️ TIPPING RISK)

Rack capacity: _____ lbs
Current load: _____ lbs

Environmental Protection:
☐ Covered/tarped (protects from rain)
☐ Shaded (prevents thermal stress)
☐ Secured against wind
☐ None (⚠️ DAMAGE RISK)

Security/Access Control:
☐ Fenced/restricted area
☐ Signage ("Authorized Personnel Only")
☐ Open area (⚠️ PUBLIC ACCESS RISK)

Wind Protection:
Is storage area protected from wind? ☐ Yes ☐ No
If no, maximum wind before moving glass indoors: _____ mph

💡 Agent Note: Glass tipping from rack = struck-by incident. Agent 3 looks for "leaning" + "no securing" combination.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Storage area overview (full setup)
✓ Glass racks (A-frame or vertical)
✓ Distance from edge (if applicable)
✓ Environmental protection (tarps, covers)
✓ Security measures (fencing, signage)

Q12: Glass Transport Path Safety
Current: "Glass Transport Path Safety"
Optimized:
🚶‍♂️ GLASS TRANSPORT ROUTE & HAZARDS

Transport Method:
☐ Crane lift (glass never manually carried)
☐ Manual carry by crew (how many people: _____)
☐ Cart/dolly
☐ Combination (describe): ______________

Transport Distance:
Horizontal: _____ feet
Vertical: _____ feet (stairs, ramps, lifts)
Total time per trip: _____ minutes

Transport Path Hazards:
☐ Level, clear path
☐ Stairs/steps (number: _____)
☐ Ramps (slope: _____ degrees)
☐ Doorways/narrow passages (width: _____ inches)
☐ Overhead obstacles (clearance: _____ feet)
☐ Uneven surface (describe): ______________

Trip/Slip Hazards on Path:
☐ None identified
☐ Cables/hoses crossing path
☐ Debris/materials on ground
☐ Wet/slippery areas
☐ Poor lighting
☐ Other: ______________

Hazard Mitigation:
☐ Path cleared before each transport
☐ Cables secured/marked
☐ Lighting added
☐ Non-slip mats placed
☐ None (⚠️ TRIP RISK)

Traffic Conflicts:
☐ Dedicated path (no other activity)
☐ Shared with other trades
☐ Active vehicle traffic nearby
☐ Public pedestrian traffic

Traffic Control:
☐ Spotter/escort with crew
☐ Barriers/cones marking path
☐ Radio communication with other trades
☐ None (⚠️ COLLISION RISK)

💡 Agent Note: Manual carry = high fatigue + trip risk. Agent 3 predicts "dropped glass" incidents when transport distance >50 ft with no rest points.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Transport path (full route)
✓ Any obstacles (stairs, doors, tight spots)
✓ Trip hazards identified
✓ Traffic areas (where other activity occurs)
