{site}"
This is not optional. Weather conditions directly impact construction safety (wind speeds for crane operations, temperature for PPE requirements, precipitation for slip hazards, etc.). You cannot provide accurate safety recommendations without current weather data.
STEP 1: Call getWeatherForSafetyAnalysis("${site}")
STEP 2: Wait for weather response
STEP 3: Then write your analysis incorporating the weather data
JOB SITE DETAILS:
Location: ${site}
Work Type: ${workType}
Work Height: ${workHeight} feet
Checklist Data: ${JSON.stringify(checklistData, null, 2)}
ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Weather Analysis: Call the weather function to get current conditions for the job site location and factor weather into your safety recommendations
Fall Protection: Assess fall hazards based on work height and weather conditions
Electrical Safety: Evaluate electrical risks considering weather and site conditions
General Hazards: Identify all site-specific safety concerns
OSHA Compliance: Ensure all recommendations meet current OSHA standards
Please provide a comprehensive safety analysis that includes:
WEATHER-DEPENDENT SAFETY ASSESSMENT
Current weather conditions and their impact on work safety
Weather-specific recommendations and restrictions
Forecast considerations for planning
CRITICAL SAFETY FINDINGS
Immediate hazards requiring attention
OSHA compliance status
Risk level assessment (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Fall protection requirements
Electrical safety measures
PPE requirements
Work restriction recommendations based on conditions
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Weather-related emergency procedures
Evacuation considerations
Communication protocols
Format your response as a professional safety report that a construction supervisor could use to make informed safety decisions.
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of This Prompt:
âœ… Weather Function Integration - Forces real-time weather data retrieval
âœ… Date Awareness - Explicitly tells AI the current date (fixes hallucination)
âœ… OSHA Compliance - Structured safety analysis framework
âœ… Professional Output - Formatted for construction supervisors
The prompt uses dynamic variables:
${dateString} - Current date (e.g., "Friday, September 21, 2025")
${currentYear} - Current year (2025)
${site} - Job site location from checklist
${workType} - Type of work being performed
${workHeight} - Maximum work height in feet
${checklistData} - Full checklist data as JSON
This is the exact prompt powering your JHA analysis! ðŸš€
