OSHA INDUSTRY DATA (BLS 2023):
Industry: ${oshaData.industryName}
NAICS Code: ${oshaData.naicsCode}
Injury Rate: ${oshaData.injuryRate} per 100 workers annually
Total Cases: ${oshaData.totalCases}
Data Source: ${oshaData.dataSource}

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
${JSON.stringify(weatherData, null, 2)}

RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:

1. IDENTIFY TOP 3 SPECIFIC HAZARDS
   - Be SPECIFIC: "Fall from 30ft swing stage during 35mph winds" 
   - NOT generic: "Fall hazard"
   - Focus on highest consequence and/or highest probability scenarios
   - Must be based on actual checklist content

2. FOR EACH HAZARD CALCULATE:

   A. PROBABILITY (0.0 to 1.0):
   
   Base = Industry injury rate: ${oshaData.injuryRate}/100 = ${oshaData.injuryRate/100}
   
   Hazard Type Multiplier:
   - Falls from >6ft: ×2.8 (OSHA Fatal Four: 36.5% of deaths)
   - Struck by object: ×1.6 (OSHA Fatal Four: 10.1% of deaths)
   - Electrocution: ×0.4 (OSHA Fatal Four: 8.5% of deaths)
   - Caught between: ×0.9 (OSHA Fatal Four: 7.3% of deaths)
   - Other: ×1.0
   
   Control Adequacy Multiplier:
   - Comprehensive (3+ levels of hierarchy): ×0.3
   - Adequate (2 levels): ×0.7
   - Minimal (PPE only): ×1.5
   - None identified: ×3.0
   
   Weather Multiplier (if applicable):
   ${weatherData.temperature < 32 || weatherData.temperature > 95 ? `- Extreme temp: ×1.4` : ''}
   ${weatherData.windSpeed > 25 ? `- High winds: ×1.8` : ''}
   ${weatherData.precipitation ? `- Precipitation: ×1.6` : ''}
   ${!weatherData.temperature && !weatherData.windSpeed ? `- Normal: ×1.0` : ''}
   
   Worker Experience Multiplier:
   - Expert (>5 years): ×0.6
   - Experienced (2-5 years): ×1.0
   - New (<1 year): ×2.1
   - Unknown: ×1.0
   
   Final Probability = Base × HazardType × Controls × Weather × Experience
   (Cap at 1.0 for display)

   B. CONSEQUENCE SEVERITY:
   
   Fatal (×10):
   - Death likely within 30 days
   - Examples: Fall >15ft, electrocution >50V, struck by heavy equipment
   - OSHA 1904.39: Report within 8 hours
   
   Critical (×7):
   - Hospitalization, amputation, eye loss
   - OSHA 1904.39: Report within 24 hours
   - Examples: Trench collapse burial, severe burns
   
   Serious (×4):
   - Days Away From Work (DAFW)
   - Medical treatment beyond first aid
   - Examples: Fractures, deep lacerations
   
   Minor (×1):
   - First aid only, no lost time
   - Examples: Cuts, bruises, minor strains

   C. RISK SCORE (1-100):
   
   Risk Score = (Probability × 100) × Severity Multiplier
   Cap at 100.
   
   Risk Classification:
   95-100 = EXTREME (Stop work immediately)
   75-94 = HIGH (Additional controls required)
   50-74 = MEDIUM (Enhanced monitoring)
   25-49 = LOW (Standard controls adequate)
   0-24 = MINIMAL (Routine procedures)

3. CONTROL EVALUATION (OSHA Hierarchy):
   
   For each hazard, assess controls against:
   L1-Elimination > L2-Substitution > L3-Engineering > L4-Administrative > L5-PPE
   
   Flag inadequate controls:
   - PPE-only approach (should have engineering)
   - Missing competent person designation
   - No emergency response plan
   - Controls not specific to hazard
   
   Recommend improvements following hierarchy.

4. OSHA STATISTICAL CONTEXT:
   
   For each hazard, cite relevant statistic:
   - Falls: "36.5% of construction fatalities (OSHA 2023)"
   - If industry injury rate high: "This trade has ${oshaData.injuryRate}/100 injury rate, ${Math.round((oshaData.injuryRate/35)*100)}% above construction average"
   - Weather-related: "Wet conditions increase slip/fall incidents by 60%"
