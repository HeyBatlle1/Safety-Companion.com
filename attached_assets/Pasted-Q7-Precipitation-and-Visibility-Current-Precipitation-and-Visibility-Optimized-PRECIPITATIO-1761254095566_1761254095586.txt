Q7: Precipitation and Visibility
Current: "Precipitation and Visibility"
Optimized:
🌧️ PRECIPITATION, VISIBILITY & SURFACE CONDITIONS

Current Precipitation:
☐ None / Dry
☐ Light Rain / Drizzle
☐ Heavy Rain
☐ Snow / Ice
☐ Recent Rain (surfaces still wet)

Precipitation Forecast (Next 4 Hours):
Hour 1: ☐ Dry ☐ Rain ☐ Snow
Hour 2: ☐ Dry ☐ Rain ☐ Snow
Hour 3: ☐ Dry ☐ Rain ☐ Snow
Hour 4: ☐ Dry ☐ Rain ☐ Snow

Visibility:
Current visibility: ☐ Clear (>1 mile) ☐ Reduced (fog/rain) ☐ Poor (<100 ft)
Can workers see ground level clearly? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Walking Surface Conditions:
☐ Dry and clear
☐ Wet but non-slip surface
☐ Wet and slippery
☐ Ice / frozen
☐ Debris on walking paths

Slip/Fall Precautions:
☐ Non-slip tape on platforms
☐ Squeegee/broom for water removal
☐ Sand/salt for ice
☐ Designated walking paths marked
☐ None (⚠️ CONCERN if wet)

Work in Rain Policy:
Our policy: ☐ Stop work in any rain ☐ Continue unless heavy ☐ No specific policy
ANSI recommends: NO elevated work during precipitation

🚨 CRITICAL: Rain + elevated glass work = high slip risk + reduced grip
Agent 3 predicts fall incidents when rain forecast ignored.

💡 Agent Note: Visibility affects crane operator's ability to see signals and obstacles.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Sky conditions (clouds, visibility)
✓ Ground surface conditions (wet/dry/ice)
✓ Walking surfaces on swing stage/platform
✓ Visibility from work height (can you see ground?)

SECTION 3: Glass Handling Equipment & Systems (3 Questions)
Q8: Glass Lifting and Positioning Equipment
Current: "Glass Lifting and Positioning Equipment"
Optimized:
🔧 GLASS HANDLING TOOLS & RIGGING

Primary Lifting Method:
☐ Suction Cups / Vacuum Lifters
☐ Clamps / Mechanical Grips
☐ Slings / Soft Rigging
☐ Custom Spreader Bar / Frame

Suction Cup Details (if applicable):
Number of cups: _____
Rated capacity per cup: _____ lbs
Total capacity: _____ lbs
Actual load: _____ lbs
Safety factor: _____ (should be ≥4:1)

Backup Systems:
☐ Redundant suction cups (if one fails, others hold)
☐ Secondary restraint line
☐ Safety netting below load
☐ No backup system (⚠️ SINGLE POINT FAILURE RISK)

Equipment Inspection Status:
Suction cups inspected: ☐ Today ☐ This week ☐ >1 week ago ☐ Unknown
Rigging inspected: ☐ Today ☐ This week ☐ >1 week ago ☐ Unknown
Vacuum pump tested: ☐ Today ☐ This week ☐ >1 week ago ☐ Unknown

Inspection Findings:
☐ All equipment in good condition
☐ Minor wear (still safe)
☐ Damage found (describe): ______________
☐ Not inspected (⚠️ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION)

Load Distribution:
☐ Evenly distributed across rigging points
☐ Slightly off-center but within limits
☐ Poor distribution (⚠️ LOAD SHIFT RISK)

🚨 CRITICAL: Equipment failure is the #2 cause of glass drop incidents
Agent 3 specifically looks for "no backup system" + "poor inspection" combination

💡 Agent Note: "Unknown" inspection status = Agent 1 data quality drops to 3/10

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Suction cups attached to glass (close-up)
✓ Rigging configuration (full setup)
✓ Inspection tag on equipment (date visible)
✓ Vacuum gauge reading
✓ Load distribution (even vs uneven)

Q9: Fall Protection Systems for Glass Work
Current: "Fall Protection Systems for Glass Work"
Optimized:
🪂 FALL PROTECTION SYSTEMS & RESCUE PLAN

Primary Fall Protection:
☐ Personal Fall Arrest System (PFAS) - harness + lanyard + anchor
☐ Guardrails (3-rail system, 42" high)
☐ Safety Net (below work area)
☐ Travel Restraint (prevents reaching edge)
☐ None (⚠️ AUTOMATIC NO-GO if >6 ft height)

PFAS Details (if applicable):
Harness type: ☐ Full body ☐ Other (⚠️ only full body allowed)
D-ring location: ☐ Back (correct) ☐ Chest (incorrect for fall arrest)
Lanyard type: ☐ Shock-absorbing ☐ Self-retracting ☐ Standard
Anchorage point capacity: _____ lbs (min 5,000 lbs per person required)

Inspection Status:
Harnesses inspected: ☐ Before each use (correct) ☐ Weekly ☐ Monthly ☐ Unknown
Findings: ☐ No defects ☐ Minor wear ☐ Damage (describe): _______
Who inspected: ________________ (Name + Competent Person cert?)

Fall Clearance Calculation:
Free fall distance: _____ feet
Lanyard deceleration: _____ feet
Safety margin: _____ feet (minimum 3 ft)
Total clearance needed: _____ feet
Available clearance: _____ feet
Is clearance adequate? ☐ Yes ☐ No (⚠️ COLLISION RISK)

Rescue Plan (OSHA requires rescue within 6 minutes):
☐ Rescue team on-site with descent equipment
☐ Fire department notified (ETA: _____ minutes)
☐ Self-rescue equipment available
☐ No rescue plan (⚠️ SUSPENSION TRAUMA RISK - FATAL)

Rescue Equipment On-Site:
☐ Descent/retrieval device
☐ Trauma straps (for suspension relief)
☐ AED (for cardiac arrest post-fall)
☐ First aid kit
☐ None (⚠️ EMERGENCY READINESS = FAILED)

🚨 CRITICAL: Fall from 60 ft = likely fatal. Fall protection prevents this.
But improper harness use = fall protection FAILS when needed.

OSHA 1926.502(d): Fall protection required for work >6 ft.
OSHA 1926.502(d)(15): Competent person must inspect equipment before each use.
OSHA 1926.502(d)(20): Rescue plan required within 6 minutes.

💡 Agent Note: "No rescue plan" was the emergency readiness gap in example analysis. This is a GO/NO-GO factor for Agent 4.

📷 Required Photos:
✓ Worker wearing harness (D-ring visible on back)
✓ Anchorage point (structural connection)
✓ Lanyard attached correctly
✓ Rescue equipment staged nearby
✓ Inspection tag on harness (date visible)
