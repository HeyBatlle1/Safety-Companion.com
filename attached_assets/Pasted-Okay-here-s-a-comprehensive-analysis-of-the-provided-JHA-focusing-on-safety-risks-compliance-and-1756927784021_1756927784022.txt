Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of the provided JHA, focusing on safety risks, compliance, and recommended actions.

**Subject: Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) Review: Glass Installation/Curtain Wall**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Critical Safety Risks Identified:**

*   **Fall Hazards:** Working at a height of 39.8 feet presents a significant fall hazard. The JHA mentions PFAS (Personal Fall Arrest Systems) and working from a stage platform and boom lift. *Inadequate inspection, improper use, or failure of these systems could result in serious injury or death.*
*   **Heavy Lifting/Material Handling:** The glass panels (76in x 76in, double insulated) are heavy. The query lacks specific weight, but these panels can easily exceed limits that require mechanical assistance. Manual handling of such materials introduces risks of strains, sprains, back injuries, and potential dropped object hazards.
*   **Struck-By Hazards:** Moving and installing large glass panels create a risk of objects falling and striking workers below, or workers being struck by moving equipment or the glass itself.
*   **Electrical Hazards:** While GFCI is present, continuous monitoring is vital. Damage to cords, wet conditions, and improper grounding can still create electrical shock hazards. Running off building power necessitates verifying the building's electrical system's capacity and safety.
*   **Boom Lift Operations:** Boom lifts introduce unique hazards, including tip-over, electrocution (contact with overhead lines), and collision with other objects. Proper training, inspection, and operation are critical.

**2. Compliance Status Assessment:**

*   **OSHA 1926.95 (General Requirements - Personal Protective Equipment):** Appears to be in general compliance based on the assessment of worker PPE. However, specific PPE requirements for glass handling (cut-resistant gloves, eye protection) and fall protection must be stringently followed.
*   **OSHA 1926.501 (Fall Protection):** Compliance is *partially* addressed. The assessment mentions PFAS. *However, it requires more detail.* Specifically, the anchor points for the PFAS *must* be verified as suitable by a qualified person.  The type of fall protection *must* be appropriate for the specific task, and fall distances *must* be calculated to ensure clearance.
*   **OSHA 1926.502 (Fall Protection Systems Criteria and Practices):** This section outlines the specific requirements for PFAS, guardrail systems, safety net systems, etc. The JHA must detail adherence to these criteria.
*   **OSHA 1926.416 (Use of Equipment):** Compliance appears to be addressed with the mentioned use of GFCI, *but it should be clearly documented that a competent person is inspecting the electrical equipment daily*.
*   **OSHA 1926.550 (Cranes and Derricks):** While not explicitly mentioned, if cranes or derricks are used to lift the glass panels, this standard applies.
*   **General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act):**  The employer has a general duty to protect employees from hazards, even if a specific OSHA standard doesn't exist. This applies particularly to the heavy glass panel handling.

**3. Immediate Action Items:**

*   **Weight Calculation & Safe Lifting Plan:** Immediately determine the *exact* weight of the glass panels. Develop a detailed safe lifting plan that includes:
    *   The method of lifting (manual, crane, vacuum lifter, etc.)
    *   The number of workers required (based on load limits)
    *   Clear communication protocols (hand signals, radios)
    *   Designated lifting zones
    *   Proper rigging (if applicable) with certified equipment.
*   **Fall Protection Plan Review:** Re-evaluate the fall protection plan. Ensure:
    *   All PFAS are inspected *daily* by a competent person and documented.
    *   Anchor points are certified by a qualified person.
    *   Fall distances are calculated, and swing fall hazards are addressed.
    *   Employees are trained on the proper use and limitations of their PFAS.
    *   Rescue plan in place in the event of a fall.
*   **Boom Lift Inspection and Training:** If using a boom lift:
    *   Verify operator certification and training is current.
    *   Conduct a pre-operation inspection of the boom lift, documenting findings.
    *   Ensure the boom lift is on a stable and level surface.
    *   Address potential electrocution hazards (maintain safe distance from power lines).
    *   Establish a traffic control plan to prevent collisions.
*   **Site-Specific Hazard Communication:** Hold a "toolbox talk" focusing on the specific hazards associated with the glass installation, including:
    *   Heavy lifting techniques.
    *   Fall protection procedures.
    *   Struck-by hazards and control measures.
    *   Emergency procedures.
*   **Emergency Contact Information:** Ensure readily available emergency contact information is posted on-site.

**4. Long-Term Recommendations:**

*   **Comprehensive JHA Review:** Conduct a more in-depth JHA that breaks down each step of the glass installation process. Involve workers in the JHA process to identify potential hazards.
*   **Engineering Controls:** Explore engineering controls to minimize hazards, such as vacuum lifting devices for the glass panels.
*   **Administrative Controls:** Implement administrative controls such as:
    *   Job rotation to reduce fatigue.
    *   Staggered work schedules to minimize congestion.
    *   Regular safety meetings.
*   **Written Safety Program:** Develop a comprehensive written safety program that addresses all identified hazards and includes procedures for hazard identification, risk assessment, and control.
*   **Regular Site Audits:** Conduct regular safety audits to identify potential hazards and ensure compliance with safety procedures.

**5. Training Needs:**

*   **Competent Person Training:** Designate a "Competent Person" for fall protection, electrical safety, and boom lift operation. This person needs specific training and experience to identify hazards and implement corrective actions.
*   **Refresher Training:** Provide refresher training on fall protection, heavy lifting, and electrical safety to all workers.
*   **Boom Lift Operator Training:** Ensure all boom lift operators are properly trained and certified.
*   **First Aid/CPR Training:** Ensure adequate personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.

**6. Follow-Up Requirements:**

*   **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of all JHA reviews, inspections, training, and corrective actions.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Establish a clear incident reporting procedure and investigate all incidents to prevent recurrence.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously review and update the JHA and safety program based on incident investigations, changes in work practices, and new regulations.
*    **Regularly scheduled third party safety audits**.

**Practical Implementation Guidance:**

*   **Consult with a Qualified Person:**  Engage a qualified safety professional or engineer to assist with developing and implementing the safety plan, especially regarding fall protection and heavy lifting.
*   **Utilize Checklists:** Develop checklists for equipment inspections, pre-job safety briefings, and other critical safety tasks.
*   **Communicate Effectively:** Ensure clear communication between workers, supervisors, and management regarding safety issues.
*   **Lead by Example:**  Management must demonstrate a commitment to safety by actively participating in safety activities and enforcing safety rules.

By implementing these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and injuries during the glass installation project and maintain compliance with OSHA regulations. Remember that this is a general assessment based on the provided information. A thorough on-site assessment is always recommended.
