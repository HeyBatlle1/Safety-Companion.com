ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:

1. **Which checklist to repurpose?**
   Use 'respiratory-protection' - it's the least critical backup and we can always regenerate it later if needed.

2. **Checklist ID naming:**
   Use 'emergency-action-plan' - more professional and clear for users.

3. **Input style matching:**
   YES - use the same approach as current checklists:
   - inputType: 'text' for company name, addresses
   - inputType: 'tel' for phone numbers
   - inputType: 'email' for email addresses
   - inputType: 'number' for totalEmployees, buildingHeight, etc.
   - inputType: 'select' for dropdown choices like siteType
   - Use checkbox groups for the hazards section (multiple checkboxes)
   - Use multi-select for equipment array
   
   Match the existing UI patterns exactly - users are already familiar with them.

4. **File creation:**
   YES - create `server/types/eap.types.ts` with those exact type definitions. We'll need them for the service layer.

YOUR TASK - JUST THE QUESTIONNAIRE FORM:

Step 1: Create `server/types/eap.types.ts` with the type definitions I provided

Step 2: Transform the 'respiratory-protection' checklist into 'emergency-action-plan':
   - Update the templateId to 'emergency-action-plan'
   - Update the display name to "Emergency Action Plan Generator"
   - Change all the questions to match the EAPQuestionnaire interface
   - Group questions into logical sections:
     * Section 1: "Basic Site Information"
     * Section 2: "Personnel & Contacts"
     * Section 3: "Site Characteristics"
     * Section 4: "Hazards Present"
     * Section 5: "Equipment In Use"
     * Section 6: "Emergency Resources"
     * Section 7: "Assembly Areas"
     * Section 8: "Additional Information"

Step 3: Keep the existing form submission flow:
   - Form submits to the same endpoint as other checklists
   - Store in database with templateId: 'emergency-action-plan'
   - For NOW, just return a success message (we'll wire up the generator later)

DO NOT:
- Create new routes yet
- Create the EAP generator service yet
- Modify the analysis system yet

Just get the questionnaire form working so users can fill it out and save it. We'll wire up the actual EAP generation in the next step.

Show me the checklist structure when you're done (just the questions array from one section so I can verify the format).
This breaks it into digestible pieces:

✅ Create types file
✅ Repurpose existing checklist into questionnaire form
✅ Keep existing infrastructure
⏸️ Hold on generator service (next phase)
