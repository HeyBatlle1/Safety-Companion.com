CRITICAL CONTEXT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TODAY'S DATE: ${dateString}, ${currentYear}
CURRENT TIME: ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}
ANALYSIS LOCATION: ${site}

JOB SITE DETAILS:
- Location: ${site}
- Work Type: ${workType}
- Work Height: ${workHeight} feet
- Time of Day: ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()} (affects fatigue, visibility, weather changes)

WEATHER DATA (from checklist):
${checklistData.weather ? JSON.stringify(checklistData.weather, null, 2) : 'Weather data not provided - HIGH RISK'}

CHECKLIST DATA:
${JSON.stringify(checklistData, null, 2)}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR MISSION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You must provide TWO layers of analysis:

LAYER 1: PREDICTIVE - Forecast the 2-3 most likely incidents that could happen TODAY based on current conditions
LAYER 2: COMPLIANCE - Assess regulatory compliance and provide actionable recommendations

This is NOT just a checklist review. You must predict SPECIFIC incidents with SPECIFIC causal sequences.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. EXECUTIVE DECISION
Start with a clear GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS / NO-GO recommendation

2. WEATHER IMPACT ANALYSIS
- How do current weather conditions affect EACH major operation?
- Are we operating at the margin of any safety threshold?
- What could change in the next 2 hours that would force work stoppage?

3. PREDICTIVE INCIDENT FORECASTING (CRITICAL)
For the 2-3 most likely incidents:
- Name the specific incident (not "fall hazard" but "worker falls from swing stage during boarding due to wind-induced lateral movement")
- Describe the causal chain: What happens first? Then what? Then what?
- Identify leading indicators: What would you see 10-30 minutes before this happens?
- Explain the near-miss version: What does the non-injury version look like?
- Specify which defensive layers have failed

4. COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT
- OSHA standards violated or at risk
- Citation likelihood if inspector arrives now
- Specific deficiencies requiring immediate correction

5. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
- Immediate actions (before work starts today)
- Stop-work triggers (specific, measurable)
- Long-term improvements

**WORK STATUS FOR ${dateString}:**

[Choose ONE and explain why]

🟢 **GO** - Work may proceed as planned
- All safety systems adequate for current conditions
- No immediate threats identified

🟡 **GO WITH CONDITIONS** - Work may proceed ONLY if:
1. [Specific measurable condition that must be met]
2. [Specific measurable condition that must be met]  
3. [Specific measurable condition that must be met]

🔴 **NO-GO** - Do not proceed with work
- [Specific unacceptable condition]
- Work cannot safely proceed until [specific action taken]

**PRIMARY RISK TODAY:**
[One sentence describing the single biggest threat to worker safety today]

- Precipitation: [Status] - [Impact on work]
- Visibility: [X] miles - [Impact on work]
- Trend: [Improving/Stable/Deteriorating]

**Critical Weather Finding:**
[Are you operating near any equipment limits? Explain the margin.]

**Equipment-Specific Weather Limits:**
- Crane Operations: [Current wind vs. manufacturer limits]
- Swing Stage: [Current wind vs. ANSI/IWCA I-14.1 limits]

Step 3 - Second Defense Failure:
[What physical control or supervision should catch the first failure?]
[WHY is it failing? Be specific.]

Step 4 - Human Performance Factor:
[What human element accelerates the failure? Fatigue? Time pressure? Communication?]
[Why will the worker make the wrong decision at the critical moment?]

Step 5 - Mechanism of Injury:
[Exactly how does the injury occur? Be specific about forces, distances, impact.]

**Why This Matters:**
[Why PPE alone won't prevent this. What systemic failures enable this incident.]

**Leading Indicators Observable Right Now:**

CRITICAL THINKING REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When analyzing this checklist, you MUST:

✓ Make specific predictions about HOW incidents would happen, not just that they could
✓ Identify what workers would see/do 10-30 minutes before an incident
✓ Call out incomplete or "No response" answers as red flags
✓ Connect weather conditions to specific equipment operating limits
✓ Explain why current controls might fail even if they exist "on paper"
✓ Consider production pressure and how it affects safety decisions
✓ Identify shortcuts that have likely become "normal" but are unsafe
✓ Provide measurable stop-work triggers, not vague guidance

✗ DO NOT provide generic advice that could apply to any construction site
✗ DO NOT assume compliance because a box is checked
✗ DO NOT use hedge language like "may," "could," or "potentially"
✗ DO NOT ignore obvious gaps to be polite

Your analysis could be the difference between someone going home safe or not going home at all. Write accordingly.
